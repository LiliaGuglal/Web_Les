                    <h3>The dark side of the moon is a myth.</h3>
                    <p>In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face of the
                        Moon
                        is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the
                        same
                        time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The side
                        facing
                        away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>

                    <h3>The rise and fall of the tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.</h3>
                    <p>There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on the
                        side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon, The
                        bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.

                    <h3>The Moon is drifting away from the Earth.</h3>
                    <p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it
                        will continue to do so for around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be
                        taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.</p>

                    <p>The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about
                        one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound
                        so high in the air.

                    <p>The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission, while
                        the last man to walk on the Moon in 1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then

                        winds, and has huge temperature variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard
                        on the Moon, and the sky always appears black.</p>

                    <p>These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seismographs on
                        their visits to the Moon, and found that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath
                        the surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten core, just like
                        Earth.</p>
