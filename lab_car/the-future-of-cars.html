                        <strong>I</strong>n the last hangar off the runway in Prineville, Oregon, Sam Bousfield locked
                        down one of the
                        wings
                        to his flying car. His engineer was busy burnishing the parabolic slope of the carbon-fiber
                        finish.
                        Bousfield handed me half a tail wing. It floated in my hand, light as balsa wood. “Eight
                        pounds,” he
                        said, which, for a structural component of an airplane, is almost nothing. Off in the far side
                        of
                        the hangar sat his original wooden mock-up of the chassis, a three-wheeled aerodynamic lozenge
                        right
                        out of a manga enthusiast’s idea of a speed racer. He encouraged me to climb in and get a feel
                        for
                        the feng shui of the driver’s seat, the view out the windshield, the sense of balance. But what
                        he
                        really wanted me to see was that this thing was real—that the flying car is no longer in that
                        jetpack realm of promising technology that never quite arrives. “I expect to take this car into
                        the
                        air in June,” he said.

                        <strong>T</strong>he automobile has long been a symbol of everything great and everything
                        terrible about America.
                        On
                        the one hand: freedom, individualism, power, speed. The taming of millions of miles of varied
                        wildernesses through roads, then highways, then interstates. The capacity of American
                        industry—Pittsburgh’s steel, Akron’s rubber, Detroit’s factories.

                        But on the other hand: gas-guzzling SUVs. Traffic and sprawl. The abandonment of mass transit.
                        The
                        suburb and then the exurb, with their undeniable ties to white flight and segregation. The
                        decline
                        of the Rust Belt, the near-collapse of the Big Three automakers during the Great Recession of
                        2008,
                        and the slow death of American manufacturing and blue-collar work.

                        <strong>F</strong>lying cars have been part of our science-fiction dreams ever since Henry Ford
                        pitched an early
                        personal airplane back in 1926—Ford’s aircraft division actually tried to build a "Model T of
                        the
                        air." Ninety years later, discarded prototypes litter junkyards and collectors’ garages, but no
                        viable mass-market product has ever emerged.
                        That might still change. The latest candidates include Skycar, a flying-car prototype, and the
                        Ehang
                        184, an autonomous electric quadcopter introduced at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, in Las
                        Vegas. In 2013, a company called Terrafugia announced plans for a self-flying car; it expects to
                        have a prototype ready for testing by 2018. A commercial model will take at least another five
                        years.
